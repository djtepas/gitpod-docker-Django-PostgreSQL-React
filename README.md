# Pre-built Workspace for My Development
I needed a workspace I could use to start projects from in Gitpod and I didn't find a existing example done the way I wanted. Please keep in mind that my development is all done as a hobby.

## Requirements for the workspace
These are my basic setup items I use when building a new website.

* PostgresSQL database
* Python
    * Django
* Node JS
    * React

## Steps Used

1. Start with prebuilt "workspace-postgresql"
2. Check Python verion --> 3.8.6
3. Check Node verion --> v12.20.0
