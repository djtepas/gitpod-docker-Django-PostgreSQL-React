# Pre-built Workspace for My Development
I needed a workspace I could use to start projects from in Gitpod and I didn't find a existing example done the way I wanted. Please keep in mind that my development is all done as a hobby.

## Requirements for the workspace
These are my basic setup items I use when building a new website.

* PostgresSQL database
* Python
    * Django
* Node JS
    * React


## References used to build the workspace
